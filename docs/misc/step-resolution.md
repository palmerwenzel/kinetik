**Analysis**

In Expo Router (and Next.js App Router), each file under a folder becomes its own route segment. A file named “visibility.tsx” in “app/(groups)/createGroup/steps” is accessible at something like “/(groups)/createGroup/steps/visibility”, provided that there’s no extra folder layout interfering.

At first glance, the code for pushing from “basics” to “visibility” looks logical:

router.push("../steps/visibility")

…yet it yields an “Unmatched Route.” The main culprit is almost always that the "../steps/..." relative reference is not mapping to a real route the way we expect. In particular, Expo Router’s folder-based routing has some nuances with “group” folders (like “(groups)”) or nested “\_layout.tsx” files. Relative segments such as “../steps/xyz” can get you into the wrong directory level, especially if it thinks you’ve gone up one folder and then back into “steps” again (leading to “/--/steps/visibility”).

**Likely Reasons for the Mismatch**

1. There is no dedicated “steps/\_layout.tsx”:
   - If “steps” does not have its own layout, then pushing a route with “../steps/...” from inside “steps” can break because the router is unsure how to nest the paths.
2. The relative path is overshooting or undershooting:

   - From “app/(groups)/createGroup/steps/basics.tsx,” a reference to “../steps/visibility” might produce the incorrect final path. In many cases, the correct approach is to simply push “visibility” (the sibling route) or “./visibility” (relative) rather than going up and back down.

3. We may be over-engineering the route references by always doing “../steps/${stepName}”:

   - If you’re already inside “app/(groups)/createGroup/steps/…,” you typically only need “router.push(‘visibility’)” or “router.push(‘posting’)” to jump to a sibling.

4. No layout bridging “basics,” “visibility,” “posting,” etc.:
   - If you want them to be siblings, you can create “app/(groups)/createGroup/steps/\_layout.tsx” so that “basics.tsx” and “visibility.tsx” are simply different screens in that same stack. Then “router.push('visibility')” should just work.

**How to Fix It**

1. Simplify your relative routes. For example, in “basics.tsx”:

   Instead of:

   ```typescript
   onNext={() => router.push("../steps/visibility")}
   ```

   use:

   ```typescript
   onNext={() => router.push("visibility")}
   ```

   This way you’re navigating to the sibling “visibility.tsx” within the same folder.

2. Consider adding a “\_layout.tsx” in “steps/” if you want a shared layout/stack for these sub-pages. For example, a “steps/\_layout.tsx” might look like this:

   ```typescript:app/(groups)/createGroup/steps/_layout.tsx
   import { Stack } from "expo-router";

   export default function StepsLayout() {
     return (
       <Stack
         screenOptions={{
           // any screen options you like
           headerShown: false,
         }}
       />
     );
   }
   ```

   With that in place, each file (“basics.tsx,” “visibility.tsx,” etc.) becomes a sibling screen in the same stack.

3. Double-check your STEPS array logic. If you rely on:
   ```typescript
   const stepRoute = STEPS[step - 1].id;
   router.push(`../steps/${stepRoute}`);
   ```
   …you might need to trim off the “../steps/” piece in favor of a simple relative push if you’re already inside “steps.” For example:
   ```typescript
   router.push(`${stepRoute}`);
   ```
   or
   ```typescript
   router.push(`./${stepRoute}`);
   ```

**Conclusion**

You are not missing a file per se, but rather the routing references are tripping you up. The simplest remedy is to remove the “../steps/” prefix when navigating among siblings in “steps/” and to optionally give “steps” its own “\_layout.tsx.” That way, each step (basics, visibility, posting, review) can be a route screen under the same stack, and you can cleanly navigate via:

router.push("visibility")

…without introducing unmatched routes like “/--/steps/visibility.”
