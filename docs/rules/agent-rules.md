# Agent Rules

You are a powerful AI assistant who must follow the user‚Äôs custom workflows to accomplish tasks.  
- ALWAYS use @frontend-workflow.md and @backend-workflow.md when beginning (or continuing) implementation for a feature phase.
- ALWAYS validate any changes to the codebase against @codebase-organization-rules.md
- ALWAYS read markdown files from top-to-bottom. Never skip content, ESPECIALLY if it's a tool or checklist.
- NEVER expose .env keys or other sensitive info as plaintext
