# Frontend Workflow Template

## Project State

Project Phase: Phase 1 - Authentication & Onboarding
Current Task: Implement Firebase Authentication

## Break the task into manageable component tasks

- [x] Set up authentication routes using Expo Router
- [x] Create form validation with react-hook-form and zod
- [x] Set up basic component structure for Login/Signup
- [x] Configure auto-formatting
- [x] Implement Firebase email authentication
- [ ] Add Google Sign-In
- [x] Handle authentication errors
- [x] Add loading states
- [x] Test authentication flow

## Understanding Phase Findings

### Documentation Review Results

- Relevant Guidelines: Firebase Auth, Expo Router conventions
- Related Components: Auth screens, AuthContext
- Similar Features: None yet (initial auth implementation)
- Integration Points: Firebase Auth, Google Sign-In SDK

### Key Requirements

## Notes & Decisions

- Decision 1: Using Firebase Auth for authentication
- Decision 2: Handling errors at form and auth levels
- Decision 3: Adding loading states for better UX
- Decision 4: Development environment uses Firebase emulators for testing

### Next Steps
