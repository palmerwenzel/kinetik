# Frontend Workflow Template

## Project State

Project Phase: Phase 1.5 - Video Feed MVP
Current Task: Implement TikTok-style video feed with vertical swipe navigation

## Break the task into manageable component tasks

- Set up full-screen video feed container
- Implement vertical swipe navigation
- Create video player component with basic controls
- Add autoplay/pause on swipe functionality
- Implement loading states and placeholders

## Understanding Phase Findings

### Documentation Review Results

- Technical Guidelines: Expo AV for video playback, React Native Gesture Handler for swipes
- Related Components: Existing AnimatedContainer and UI components
- Similar Features: None yet (first video implementation)
- Integration Points: Firebase Storage for video content

### Key Requirements

- Functional:
  - Full-screen video playback
  - Smooth vertical swipe navigation
  - Autoplay/pause on swipe
  - Basic video controls
- Technical:
  - Use Expo AV for video playback
  - Implement efficient view recycling
  - Handle video buffering states
  - Manage memory efficiently
- Design:
  - Full-screen immersive experience
  - Smooth transitions between videos
  - Loading states and placeholders
  - Minimal UI overlays

## Planning Phase Results

### Architecture Plan

- Component Structure:
  - VideoFeed container (manages swipe and state)
  - VideoPlayer component (handles playback)
  - VideoControls overlay (play/pause, sound)
  - LoadingPlaceholder component
- State Management:
  - Video playback states
  - Loading and buffering states
  - Current video index
- Data Flow:
  - Video URLs from Firebase
  - Playback events to UI
  - Gesture events to video control

### Technical Approach
