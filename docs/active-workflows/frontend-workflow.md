## Project State

Project Phase: Phase 2 - Video Creation MVP
Current Task: Implement in-app video recording and editing functionality

## Break the task into manageable component tasks

- [x] Set up camera access and permissions
- [ ] Switch from expo-camera to react-native-camera-kit
  - [ ] Install and configure react-native-camera-kit
  - [ ] Update VideoRecorder component
  - [ ] Test camera functionality
  - [ ] Verify video quality and performance
- [ ] Create video recording interface
- [ ] Implement basic video controls (start/stop recording)
- [ ] Add video preview functionality
- [ ] Implement basic video editing features
  - [ ] Trimming
  - [ ] Adding music/sounds
  - [ ] Basic filters
- [ ] Create upload flow for recorded videos

## Understanding Phase Findings

### Documentation Review Results

- Technical Guidelines:
  - react-native-camera-kit for video recording (Tesla's production-grade camera library)
  - Expo AV for video preview and editing
  - Expo Media Library for saving videos
  - React Native Vision Camera as alternative for advanced features
- Related Components: Existing VideoPlayer component
- Similar Features: Video playback in feed
- Integration Points: Firebase Storage for video upload

### Key Requirements

- Functional:
  - Camera access and recording
  - Video preview during/after recording
  - Basic video editing capabilities
  - Upload to Firebase Storage
- Technical:
  - Use react-native-camera-kit
  - Efficient video processing
  - Handle permissions properly
  - Manage storage efficiently
- Design:
  - Instagram/TikTok-like recording interface
  - Intuitive editing controls
  - Progress indicators
  - Clear success/error states

## Planning Phase Results

### Architecture Plan

- Component Structure:
  - VideoRecorder (handles recording)
  - VideoPreview (playback recorded content)
  - VideoEditor (editing interface)
  - EditControls (trimming, filters)
  - UploadProgress component
- State Management:
  - Recording state
  - Editing state
  - Upload progress
- Data Flow:
  - Camera feed to storage
  - Edit operations to preview
  - Final video to Firebase

### Technical Approach

- Video Recording:
  - react-native-camera-kit
  - Local storage for temp files
- Editing Features:
  - FFmpeg for video processing
  - Custom filters implementation
- Performance:
  - Efficient video processing
  - Background upload
- Key Dependencies:
  - react-native-camera-kit
  - expo-av
  - expo-media-library
  - @react-native-vision-camera
  - ffmpeg-kit-react-native

## Implementation Checklist

### Setup

- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Set up permissions handling
- [ ] Create base components

### Development Progress

- [ ] Camera interface
- [ ] Recording functionality
- [ ] Video preview
- [ ] Basic editing features
- [ ] Upload mechanism

### Integration

- [ ] Permissions flow
- [ ] Storage integration
- [ ] Upload to Firebase

## Checkpoints

- [x] Understanding complete
- [x] Planning approved
- [ ] Setup verified
- [ ] Implementation reviewed
- [ ] Integration verified
- [ ] Final review passed

## Notes & Decisions

- Using react-native-camera-kit for MVP, can upgrade to Vision Camera if needed
- Starting with basic editing features, can enhance later
- Implementing background upload for better UX
- Need to handle storage cleanup for temp files
