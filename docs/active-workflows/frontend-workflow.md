# Frontend Workflow Template

## Project State
Project Phase: Phase 0 - Project Setup & Environment Configuration
Current Task: Complete remaining setup tasks from phase-0-checklist.md

## Break the task into manageable component tasks
- Verify NativeWind setup and component styling
- Set up Firebase configuration and emulator
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
- Update project documentation

## Understanding Phase Findings
[From phase-0-checklist.md analysis]

### Documentation Review Results
- Relevant Guidelines: Codebase Organization Rules, TypeScript + React Native Rules
- Related Components: None yet (initial setup)
- Similar Features: None yet (initial setup)
- Integration Points: Firebase, NativeWind, CI/CD

### Key Requirements
- Functional: Working development environment with hot reload
- Technical: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint/Prettier enforcement
- Design: NativeWind styling system working correctly

## Planning Phase Results

### Architecture Plan
- Component Structure: Following Expo Router conventions in app/ directory
- State Management: Prepared for React Query + Context (not implemented yet)
- Data Flow: Firebase integration pending

### Technical Approach
- Styling Strategy: NativeWind with custom configuration
- Integration Points: Firebase (pending), Expo Router (configured)
- Key Dependencies: All core dependencies installed

## Implementation Checklist

### Setup
- [x] Dependencies verified
- [x] File structure created
- [x] Initial boilerplate setup

### Development Progress
- [x] NativeWind verification
- [x] Firebase configuration setup
- [x] Firebase emulator setup
- [ ] CI/CD configuration
- [ ] Documentation updates

### Integration
- [x] Firebase core setup
- [x] Firebase emulator integration
- [ ] State management setup
- [ ] Error handling configuration

## Checkpoints
- [x] Understanding complete
- [x] Planning approved
- [ ] Setup verified
- [ ] Implementation reviewed
- [ ] Integration verified
- [ ] Final review passed

## Notes & Decisions
- Decision 1: Using NativeWind for styling over NativeBase
- Decision 2: Following Expo Router file-based routing convention
- Decision 3: Firebase configuration using Expo Config Plugin system for secure environment variable handling
- Decision 4: Development environment uses Firebase emulators for local testing
- Decision 5: Firebase initialized in production mode for immediate deployment readiness

### Security Considerations
- Firestore started in production mode for immediate deployment
- Need to implement proper security rules for Firestore
- Authentication rules must be properly configured before deployment
- Local development will use emulators with separate security rules

### Next Steps
1. Configure Firestore security rules for production
2. Set up authentication rules
3. Complete emulator configuration for safe local development
4. Document production vs development environment differences
