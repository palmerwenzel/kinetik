# Frontend Workflow Template

## Project State

Project Phase: Phase 1.5 - Video Feed MVP
Current Task: Implement bottom tab navigation with Home, Feed, Create, and Profile tabs

## Break the task into manageable component tasks

- Set up navigation container with Expo Router
- Create tab bar component with neumorphic design
- Implement screen components:
  - Home (daily overview, quick actions)
  - Feed (TikTok-style video viewing)
  - Create (video upload)
  - Profile (user info, activity)
- Add tab icons and labels
- Handle navigation state and transitions

## Understanding Phase Findings

### Documentation Review Results

- Relevant Guidelines: [@theme-rules.md](../rules/theme-rules.md) for neumorphic design
- Related Components: Existing AuthContext and profile components
- Similar Features: None yet (first navigation implementation)
- Integration Points: Expo Router, existing auth flow

### Key Requirements

- Functional:
  - Bottom tab navigation with 4 main tabs
  - Home screen with daily overview
  - Feed screen for video content
  - Create screen for uploads
  - Profile screen for user info
  - Proper navigation state management
  - Auth-aware routing
- Technical:
  - Use Expo Router for file-based routing
  - Follow React Navigation best practices
  - Maintain type safety
- Design:
  - Neumorphic style for tab bar
  - Clear active/inactive states
  - Smooth transitions

## Planning Phase Results

### Architecture Plan

- Component Structure:
  - \_layout.tsx for root layout
  - (app)/\_layout.tsx for authenticated layout
  - (app)/home/index.tsx for Home tab
  - (app)/feed/index.tsx for Feed tab
  - (app)/create/index.tsx for Create tab
  - (app)/profile/index.tsx for Profile tab
- State Management:
  - Use Expo Router for navigation state
  - Leverage existing AuthContext
- Data Flow:
  - Navigation events trigger route changes
  - Auth state determines available routes

### Technical Approach

- Styling Strategy:
  - NativeWind for layout
  - Custom neumorphic components for tabs
- Integration Points:
  - Auth flow integration
  - Screen transitions
- Key Dependencies:
  - expo-router
  - @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
  - nativewind
