## *Share Your Journey, Inspire Others*

## Background

In a world where staying connected and engaged with your passions is vital, it can be challenging to keep the momentum going on your own. Kinetik is a social platform designed for sharing your daily experiences—whether it's staying on top of your fitness, experimenting with a recipe, exploring creative projects, or simply enjoying moments with friends. The platform is built to foster accountability, spark camaraderie, and promote personal growth through authentic, user-generated content across any area of interest.

## Core Purposes

- **Accountability**: Share daily or weekly snippets of your experiences to maintain your momentum and help each other stay on track.
- **Camaraderie**: Build and join groups with friends who share your interests, creating a supportive and engaging community.
- **Growth & Learning**: Exchange ideas, tips, and insights—whether it's a new technique in cooking, a novel way to work out, or any creative endeavor—to continually evolve and get inspired.

## Build for 2 Types of Users

1. **Content Creator**: Users who document and share their personal journeys—be it hobbies, creative projects, or everyday milestones.
2. **Community Member**: Users who engage with the shared content by joining groups, commenting, and drawing inspiration from friends and like-minded individuals.

## Define User Stories

**User Stories (Creators)**:
- "As a creator, I want to post daily snippets of my experiences so I can document my journey and inspire others."
- "As a creator, I want to set privacy controls (public, friends-only, or group-specific) for each post so I can tailor who sees my content."
- "As a creator, I want to tag my posts with relevant themes (e.g., reading, cooking, creating) to help others easily discover content that resonates with their interests."

**User Stories (Viewers)**:
- "As a viewer, I want to follow creators who interest me so I can share in their experiences."
- "As a viewer, I want to interact with posts by liking and commenting to exchange ideas and show support."
- "As a viewer, I want to view content grouped by my interests so I can continually find inspiration and learn new things."

## Build Vertically

Develop a complete feature that embodies the essence of Kinetik:
- **Experience Sharing Pipeline**: Enable seamless group creation, flexible content posting with customizable privacy settings, and a dynamic feed that aggregates posts based on group membership and shared interests.

Focus on delivering an intuitive and engaging experience that enhances accountability, strengthens bonds, and promotes continuous personal growth through shared experiences.
